This paper presents an integer programming framework designed to effectively address the complex final exam scheduling challenges encountered at Cornell University. With a high degree of flexibility, the framework is specifically tailored to accommodate diverse constraints, including the front-loading of large courses and the exclusion of specific time slots during the exam period. By generating multiple scheduling model variants and incorporating heuristic approaches, our framework enables comprehensive comparisons of different schedules. This empowers the University Registrar to make informed decisions, considering trade-offs in terms of schedule comfort measured by different levels of exam conflicts. Our results demonstrate significant time and effort savings for the university administration while enhancing student and faculty satisfaction.
