# abstract: 'Transitions to electric vehicles are expected to increase electricity use in residences where most users tend to recharge. To maximize household benefits and address potential grid load challenges, this study develops a mathematical programming framework for shifting residential electric vehicle charging during low electricity pricing hours to minimize the additional electricity costs that a household incurs from charging their vehicle. The model developed also aims to meet additional households' and their community's preferences by adopting four secondary objectives: charging as soon as possible when the user arrives at home, charging as late as possible before the user leaves home, charging for valley filling and peak shaving of the residential load, and charging in a shared community hub by using a DC fast charging (DCFC) station. We analyze granular residential energy data of a sample of Austin households in 2018. Based on the residential energy consumption and electric vehicle charging patterns, we conduct an empirical analysis to compare the electricity bills of the households under different electricity pricing schemes. We observe that installing a separate meter for EVs is more expensive than considering EVs as another residential plug load if the behavior of the drivers does not shift. However, households should adjust their charging behaviors under time-of-use EV charging tariffs, which is tested in the optimization model. All four secondary charging objectives result in avoiding the on-peak period of the EV charging rate and minimizing households' electricity billing costs. While charging as soon as possible, charging as late as possible, and charging in a shared DCFC station allow drivers to have greater flexibility and free (no charging) time, charging for valley filling and peak shaving of the residential load not only achieves the same cost reduction effect but also flattens the load curve and avoids high peak loads.'
