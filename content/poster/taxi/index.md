title: Taxi Routing Optimization
date: 2022-09-22T01:04:05.220Z
summary: "A taxi routing problem can be solved via bipartite matching, where a
  maximum cardinality matching corresponds to the minimum number of taxis needed
  to cover all trips.  We prove a min-max theorem: the maximum number of
  pairwise incompatible trips equals the minimum number of taxis needed."
