I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Georgia Tech ISyE, where I am advised by Prof. [Pascal Van Hentenryck](https://sites.gatech.edu/pascal-van-hentenryck/). 
Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I received my B.S. in Operations Research and Engineering at Cornell University. I was fortunate to work with Profs. [David Shmoys](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shmoys/), [Shane Henderson](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/shane-g-henderson), and [David Goldberg](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/david-alan-goldberg) at Cornell, as well as Prof. [Eleftheria Kontou](https://publish.illinois.edu/kontou/) at UIUC.

My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization and machine learning, with a particular focus on applications that drive real-world impact in logistics and transportation. My work focuses on *Large-Scale Decision-Making Under Uncertainty* across two primary directions:

- **Learning to Accelerate Optimization:** Leveraging machine learning to speed up large-scale solvers through ML-guided heuristics and end-to-end learning using “optimization proxies”.

- **Contextual Optimization:** Utilizing contextual information to improve optimization outcomes via contextual stochastic optimization, decision-focused learning, and conformal prediction.

Most recently, I have expanded my research to explore the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Operations Research for decision support systems.
